This project presents an interactive Human Resources (HR) Analytics Dashboard created using Power BI. The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive, data-driven view of employee attrition within the organization. By visualizing key metrics and demographic breakdowns, the dashboard enables HR and management teams to quickly identify trends, pinpoint high-risk employee segments, and inform targeted retention strategies.

⚙️ Technical Stack
Tool: Power BI (Desktop & Service)

Data Source: [Describe the dataset, e.g., "A simulated HR dataset," "Internal company data (anonymized)"]

Key Techniques: Data cleaning, custom DAX measures, data modeling, and visually engaging report design.

🔑 Key Metrics & Insights
The dashboard offers a one-page, holistic view of the company's HR statistics, focusing on three main departments: Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales.

Metric	Value	Description
Total Employee Count	1,470	The current total number of employees.
Total Attrition	237	The total number of employees who have left the company.

Avg Years	7.01	Average years of service for current employees.

That's a fantastic-looking Power BI dashboard! To create a great README.md for your GitHub repository, you'll want to cover the project's purpose, the data used, the key metrics, and how someone can view or interact with it.

Here is a template you can use. Remember to replace the bracketed placeholders with your specific details.
